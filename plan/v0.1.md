### Project Checklist: AI-Powered QA Copilot (Cirkitly Style) - v1 (Completed)

**Project Goal:** Develop a Pocket Flow-based RAG QA system capable of answering questions from a knowledge base, with robust, production-ready test suites that ensure code quality and functionality.

---

#### Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Understanding

*   **1.1 Environment Setup**
    *   [x] Verify `requirements.txt` includes `pocketflow`, `requests`, `pytest`, `scikit-learn`.
    *   [x] Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   [x] Set environment (used Ollama, making OpenAI key not applicable).
*   **1.2 Initial Code Review**
    *   [x] Understand the existing `nodes.py`.
    *   [x] Understand `flow.py` and `main.py` structure.
    *   [x] Understand `utils/call_llm.py` and its interaction with the LLM.
*   **1.3 Run Current Example**
    *   [x] Execute `python main.py` and immediately improved it to be interactive.

---

#### Phase 2: Detailed Design & Specification (Your "Specs" for Testing)

*   **2.1 Refine `docs/design.md`**
    *   [x] **Requirements**: Implemented the RAG user story.
    *   [x] **Flow Design**: Implemented the 4-node RAG flow.
    *   [ ] Update the Mermaid diagram (Skipped in favor of self-documenting code in `flow.py`).
    *   [x] **Utility Functions**: Implemented `call_llm` and `get_embedding`.
    *   [x] **Shared Store**: Defined and used the `shared` dictionary state.
    *   [x] **Node Steps**: Implemented `prep`, `exec`, and `post` for all nodes.
    *   [x] **Error Handling Scenarios**: Implemented and tested for API failures and empty knowledge bases.

---

#### Phase 3: Core Feature Development (RAG Implementation)

*   **3.1 Implement `utils/get_embedding.py`**
    *   [x] Create `get_embedding` function using Ollama's API.
    *   [x] Add robust `try-except` for API errors.
*   **3.2 Implement `nodes.py` updates**
    *   [x] Modify `GetQuestionNode`.
    *   [x] Add `EmbeddingNode`.
    *   [x] Add `RetrievalNode`.
    *   [x] Modify `AnswerNode`.
*   **3.3 Update `flow.py`**
    *   [x] Import and connect all nodes for the RAG sequence.
*   **3.4 Update `main.py`**
    *   [x] Refactored `main.py` for an interactive loop.
    *   [x] Removed all hardcoded questions.
    *   [x] Printed all relevant results for debugging.

---

#### Phase 4: Test Suite Development (Production-Ready)

*   **4.1 Test File Structure**
    *   [x] Created `tests/` directory with `test_nodes.py`, `test_utils.py`, `test_flow.py`.
*   **4.2 Generate Unit Tests (`tests/test_utils.py`)**
    *   [x] Tested `call_llm` for success, errors, and caching.
    *   [x] Tested `get_embedding` for success and errors.
*   **4.3 Generate Unit Tests (`tests/test_nodes.py`)**
    *   [x] Tested each Node's `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods in isolation.
*   **4.4 Generate Integration Tests (`tests/test_flow.py`)**
    *   [x] Tested the end-to-end `create_qa_flow`.
    *   [x] Verified the final `shared` state after a full run.
*   **4.5 Initial Test Run**
    *   [x] Ran `pytest` and fixed failures, hardening the codebase.

---

#### Phase 5: Iterative Refinement & Quality Assurance

*   **5.1 Analyze Test Failures**
    *   [x] Pinpointed and fixed bugs in error-handling logic based on test results.
*   **5.2 Refine Code Based on Failures**
    *   [x] **Implement Real Retrieval Logic**: Used `scikit-learn` for vector similarity search.
    *   [x] **Add a document loading/indexing mechanism**: Implemented loading from the `knowledge_source` directory.
    *   [x] **Improve Error Handling**: Refactored `try-except` blocks for clarity.
    *   [x] **Input Validation**: Added checks for an empty knowledge base.
    *   [x] **Prompt Engineering**: Iterated on the `AnswerNode` prompt.
*   **5.3 Continuous Testing**
    *   [x] Re-ran `pytest` after every major change to ensure no regressions.

---

#### Phase 6: Finalization & Documentation

*   **6.1 All Tests Pass**
    *   [x] Confirmed `pytest` runs cleanly with 100% passing tests.
*   **6.2 Final Code Review**
    *   [x] Ensured code is clean and removed debugging prints.
*   **6.3 Update Documentation**
    *   [ ] Update `docs/design.md` (Skipped).
    *   [x] Updated `README.md` with "Getting Started" and usage instructions.

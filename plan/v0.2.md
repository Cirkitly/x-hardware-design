### Project Checklist: Cirkitly v1.2

**Project Goal:** Implement user-facing refinements like an overwrite guard and a human-in-the-loop review step to improve usability and safety.

---

#### Phase 1: User Experience Enhancements

*   **1.1. Implement an Overwrite Guard:**
    *   [ ] In `FileWriterNode`, before writing the test file, check if the file already exists.
    *   [ ] If it does, use the TUI to prompt the user: `test_spi.c already exists. Overwrite? (y/n)`.
    *   [ ] If the user answers 'n', the flow should stop gracefully.

*   **1.2. Add a "Human-in-the-Loop" Review Step:**
    *   [ ] After the `TestRefinementNode`, but before `FileWriterNode`, add a new `ReviewNode`.
    *   [ ] `ReviewNode` will use the TUI to print the generated code to the console with syntax highlighting.
    *   [ ] It will then ask the user for approval: `Save this generated test file? (y/n)`.
    *   [ ] If the user answers 'n', the flow should stop without writing the file.

*   **1.3. Update Flow and TUI:**
    *   [ ] Update `flow.py` to include the new `ReviewNode`.
    *   [ ] Enhance `tui.py` to support "Yes/No" prompts and syntax-highlighted code printing.

#### Phase 2: Finalization

*   **2.1. Full-Flow Testing:**
    *   [ ] Run the entire flow and test both the overwrite and review prompts.
*   **2.2. Update `README.md`:**
    *   [ ] Document the new interactive prompts.
*   **2.3. Code Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Review all new code for clarity and comments.

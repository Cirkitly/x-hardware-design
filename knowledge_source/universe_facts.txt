The ultimate fate of the universe is a topic of ongoing cosmological research. The most widely accepted theory, based on current observations, is the "heat death" or "Big Freeze" scenario. In this future, the universe continues to expand indefinitely. Over trillions of years, all stars will burn out, galaxies will dissolve, and eventually, even black holes will evaporate through Hawking radiation, leaving behind only a cold, dark, and uniform sea of low-energy particles.
